\section*{Introduction}

Mating and reproduction affect many facets of an individual phenotype,
changing its appearance and shape or shaping its life history and
behaviour \citep{Darwin1871}. Across species the mating system is
associated with a set of behaviours aiming at pairing individuals with
sexual partners and increasing their reproductive success
\citep{emlen_ecology_1977,Clutton-Brock1989a,Wittenberger1979}. Males of
polygynous species frequently engaged into intense male-male fights,
do not provide parental care to offspring and are often larger in size
than females. In monogamous species, commonly parents of the two sexes do care
for the offspring \citep{lukas_evolution_2013}, females chose their mating partner carefully and males often show display courtship behaviour \citep{boogert_mate_2011}. Mating behaviour may also vary among populations or individuals of the same species \citep{Lott1991,Dunbar1982}. The environmental context such as
population density or resource distribution can modulate what mating
behaviour is expressed by most males \citep{verner_influence_1966, carranza_territoriality_1990}. At the individual level, age, social status, body size
or physiological states are tightly linked with the decision to
reproduce and the type of mating tactic to be adopted. Being closely
associated to reproductive success and fitness, mating and
reproductive behaviours are under strong selection pressures and have
received a lot of attention from ecologists. A careful understanding
of the evolution of reproductive tactics and of mating systems hence
requires to assess if, when, where and how long an individual did
display reproductive-related behaviours.

Many species may, however, be secretive, inhabiting environments with
poor visibility or present a nocturnal activity, so that
reproductive-related behaviours are difficult to observe directly or
to quantify accurately \citep{maher_definitions_1995}. For instance,
we currently have a huge gap of knowledge in the reproductive
behaviour in the wild of most small felids \citep{mellen_comparative_1993}, as for example the jaguar \species{Panthera onca} \citep{leuchtenberger_courtship_2009} or ocelot  \species{Leopardus pardalis} \citep{brown_female_2011}, or several other mammals like for example aardvark \species{Orycteropus afer}, pangolins, tapirs \species{Tapirus spp.}, hippopotamuses, perccaries, viverids, because of the observation limitation imposed
by the species lifestyle and its habitat preferences \citep{wilson_handbook_2009}. In this context, indirect measures, like display of agonistic interactions monitored by
individual acoustic \citep{petruskova_repertoire-based_2016} or
spatial organization can be quantified in order to infer a territorial
status \citep{wronski_home-range_2005,corlatti_hormones_2012} or to
assess whether an individual engaged into reproduction or not. GPS
systems and activity sensors provide powerful new tools to ecologists
for remote monitoring of spatial behaviour
\citep{cagnacci_animal_2010,kie_home-range_2010,kays_terrestrial_2015}. These
devices provide intensive data acquisition with which to infer
behavioural patterns previously impossible or very difficult to
describe exhaustively from direct observation, particularly in closed
or remote and hard to access habitats. For example, in females of
large herbivores parturition date and its fawn survival over the
following weeks were inferred from sudden change in movement speed
(caribou \species{Rangifer tarandus}: \cite{demars_inferring_2013} ; mule deer
\species{Odocoileus hemionus}: \cite{long_resource_2009}\nico{j'ai trouvé sur le mule deer mais pas sur le white-tailed-deer}; red deer \species{Cervus elaphus}:
\cite{asher_use_2014}; moose \species{Alces alces}: \cite{severud_using_2015}). Similarly, \cite{silva_spatial_2017} described different lekking
behaviours among little bustard males \species{Tetrax tetrax} from GPS
locations. In marine mammals, locations of animals is frequently used
to define foraging areas of predators such as seals or large seabirds
 \citep{thiebault_splitting_2013, browning_predicting_2018,carter_navigating_2016}. Denning dates were derived from the first date with no-movement of
black bears \citep{sahlen_den_2015}. Assuming that a behaviour is associated to a change in
space use, movement or activity, this behaviour should be observable
and detected in the fine-scale locations patterns of individuals (see
Table 1\nico{que veux-tu faire dans cette table? Je pense que ce paragraphe est un peu trop long, on devrait peut-être réduire le nombre d'exemples, non?}).



Mating is a strong driver of changes in the behaviour of individuals
during the breeding season, including their movements and
activity. Depending on female spatial distribution, males may adopt
different mating tactics \citep{clutton-brock_review_1989} \nico{c'est cette ref?} implying specific
movement patterns. For species living at low density with widely
dispersed females such a large carnivores, roaming and greater
movements to find receptive mates during the mating period is a
behaviour that is expressed by many species (monkey\nico{ref?}, bears \cite{dahle_journal_2003}\nico{je propose cela!}). Males may
also engage into the defence of territories overlapping home ranges of
one or several females. Territorial behaviour often results in an
“aggressive behaviour that occurs repeatedly as a direct response to
the location of other individuals, with associated submissive
behaviour on the part of those individuals or groups to which the
aggression is directed” \citep{pyke_territoriality_1996}. In addition
to these marking and agonistic behaviours, territoriality potentially
affects the ranging behaviour and movement of males. Home range of
territorial males are smaller and with a higher density than home
ranges of floaters \citep{brown_movement_2000}. In chimpanzees patrolling
males displayed long-distance movement steps and head-directed
movements, which opposed with the more homogenous movement patterns of
lactating females \citep{bates_sex_2009}. Similarly, females and males
polar bear displayed contrasting movement parameters attributed to
their roaming and patrolling behaviours, respectively \citep{laidre_females_2012}\nico{ c'est cette référence, j'ai inversé females et males il me semble que tu t'étais trompé!}. By eliciting
particular movements of males, mating related behaviours should
therefore be detectable indirectly from movements or space use of
individuals.

The roe deer \species{Capreolus capreolus} is a weakly polygynous
large wild herbivore that inhabits most forests of Europe \citep{andersen_european_1998}. Drivers of female reproduction and the reproductive tactics
of female roe deer are relatively well known
\citep{andersen_social_1998} and fine-scale mating behaviours has been
documented recently such as mating excursions
\citep{debeffe_one_2014}. Much less is known about male mating tactics
and behaviours. The mating system of roe deer has been described as
mate defence polygyny \citep{vanpe_mating_2008} where males defend a
mating territory from early spring through the mid-summer rut, when
fertilization of females take place. While reports suggest that most
males become territorial during their fourth summer, some high quality
individuals may successfully mate at their third summer at 2.5 years old
\citep{vanpe_age-specific_2009}. Hence, despite a relatively low level
of sexual dimorphism, patterns of spatial behaviour differ markedly
between the sexes, as males only are seasonally territorial, while
females do not actively defend their home range \citep[but
see][]{maublanc_ranging_2012}. During the rut roe deer males
actively search for females performing territoriality patrolling (Cumming
1966) and scent marking \citep{gosling_reassessment_1982}, rub antlers or chase and fight with competitors generating an increase in the overall activity of animals.

Here, we used a large sample of GPS-monitored roe deer in two
intensively monitored populations in France and Germany to infer
territorial behaviour of male roe deer at both the individual and the
population levels. More specifically, we generated metrics of movement
and activity from GPS locations and activity sensors within the
collars and analysed the temporal patterns of these metrics in
relation to current knowledge on the seasonality of territorial
behaviour in this species \citep{andersen_social_1998}. In particular,
we expected to observe signals of territorial behaviour from early
spring to mid-summer ($i$) in males, but not females
\citep{andersen_mating_1998}, and ($ii$) mostly in prime-age males,
but not sub-adults or yearlings \citep{vanpe_age-specific_2009}.
\nicoin{ On vire ceci While high intensity GPS data have previously been used to infer behaviours
such as parturition (\textit{e.g.} \cite{demars_inferring_2013} in
caribou; \cite{asher_use_2014} in red deer; \cite{severud_using_2015}
in moose; \cite{walsh_estimating_2016} in wolves), foraging
\cite{evans_foraging_2013} in common murres) and predation \citep[][
in bears]{krofel_use_2013,cristescu_predicting_2015}, this is, to our
knowledge, the first time that territorial and rutting behaviours has
been inferred from remote GPS monitoring \citep[but see][on lekking in
little bustards]{silva_spatial_2017}.}

\section*{Material and Methods}
\subsection*{Study areas}

We used the extensive GPS monitoring studies from Aurignac and Bavaria
which feature in the EURODEER database
\citep{cagnacci_partial_2011}. We selected these two study sites
(Fig. 1\nico{todo}) because of the large sample sizes of monitored roe deer, and
because of the good balance between sexes and the three age-classes
they offer (see below).

The first study site is located in the Comminges region of
south-western France (N 43° 13', E 0° 52', 110 km$^2$, hereafter
AUR). The landscape is a hilly (max. 380 m a.s.l.) mixture of open
fields and small woodland patches dominated by oak \species{Quercus
  spp.}, often associated with hornbeam \species{Carpinus betulus},
with two large forests (approx. 672 and 463 ha) and numerous small
forest patches (covering 19.3\% of the site). The remainder of the
study site consists in meadows for livestock grazing (37.2\%), crops
(31.6\%), and hedgerows (3.6\%) mostly. The anthropogenic pressure is
high and homogeneous over the study site, characterized by numerous
small villages and farms connected by an extensive road network. The
climate is oceanic, \textit{i.e.} hot summers and relatively mild
winters with an average monthly temperature of 4.5°C versus 21.1°C and
63.3 mm versus 37.2 mm precipitation in January and July, respectively
over the period of the study (data from Météofrance). No large mammalian
predator has ever been seen in the area but the roe deer is commonly
hunted. Hunters stalk male roe deer during the rut period between June
and August, and conduct additional drive hunts with dogs from
September to February. \todo{C'est peut-être ça qui rend les relation
  un peu moins nettes à Aurignac non ? } \nico{peut-être, il y a aussi
  que l'activité des colliers GPS Lotek 3300 n'a rien à voir avec
  l'activité des collier Vectronics}

The second study site is located in Germany and Czech republic (N
49°01', E 13°40', 3070 km², hereafter BAV), putting together two
adjacent national parks, the Bavarian Forest National Park (240
km$^2$) and the Šumava National Park (640 km$^2$) respectively
(D:49°N). The landscape is typical of central European sub-mountainous
forest,... \todo{to be completed by Marco} Elevation varies
substantially between 600 and 1450 m a.s.l. and the site consists
essentially of forests of Norway spruce \species{picea abies L.}. The
climate is continental, with an average annual temperature ranging
between 3°C and 6.5°C depending on the elevation, and an average
annual precipitation of between 830 and 2230 mm. The roe deer is
hunted...\todo{to be completed by Marco}

\subsection*{Data collection}
For the AUR study site, from 2002-2013, roe deer were caught during
winter (from November 16th to March 27th) using net drives. Captures
consist in setting 4 km of long-nets at one of the 10 capture sites,
followed by 30--100 beaters walking inside the enclosure and driving
roe deer toward the nets. Captured animals are carefully handled and
stored into a wooden box, waiting for processing. For the BAV study
site; from 2004-2015, roe deer were caught during winter
(October–March) using wooden box traps\todo{From when to when? A bit
  more details by Marco again}. Each roe deer was sexed and aged at
capture (juveniles ca. 6-10 months old, yearlings ca. 18-22 months
old, adults $\geq$ 30 months old). Juveniles are distinguishable from
older deer by the presence of a tricuspid third pre-molar milk tooth
\citep{ratcliffe_roe_1992}, while yearlings can be quite reliably
identified from the degree of tooth wear
\citep{hewison_tests_1999}. Then, roe deer were equipped with GPS
collars (mainly Lotek 3300 for AUR and Vectronic Aerospace for BAV)
and released on site after handling.

\subsection*{Location data processing}
We first selected and standardised location data among the two study
sites. We removed all locations recorded during the first week of
monitoring after an animal’s capture and release because of potential
behavioural alterations following capture and handling
\citep{morellet_effect_2009}. Because the sampling regime of GPS
locations differed among and within study sites, we selected a
comparable number of locations per unit time for each individual
\citep{morellet_seasonality_2013}. We split the day into four periods
of six hours ([0-6[, [6-12[, [12-18[ and [18-0[) and retained the
location that was closest to the beginning of the interval for each
six hour period (\textit{i.e.} a maximum of four locations per day,
with a fix interval of approximately 6 hours). We considered six
months of monitoring as the minimum to obtain a representative
estimate of ranging behaviour over the spring-summer period and we
kept only those individuals with at least 75\% (or 90\%) of the
scheduled locations. The final sample comprised 72 and 190 individual
age classes at BAV and AUR, repectively (or 43 and 95) (average of 3.6
and 3.8 locations per day for 75\% and 90\% of scheduled locations
respectively).

In order to identify temporal changes in behaviour, we generated four
metrics of movement and activity expected to index a territorial
behaviour. As territorial species are known to perform movements in
order to detect potential intruders, to patrol borders, and to
reinforce territory ownership through marking behaviour directed
towards neighbours and peripheral individuals \citep{owen-smith_territoriality_1977}, we
expected an increase of the general mobility and activity for
individuals delimiting a territory. Then, first to describe intensity
of mobility for each individual, we calculated the residence time
\citep{barraquand_animal_2008} and the movement speed of each
individual and expected respectively a decrease of the residence time
and an increase of the speed of territorial individuals so as to
define and maintain a territory. Residence time describes how animals
alternate between intensive (area-concentrated) and extensive (ranging
and relocation) search modes, which are assumed to correspond to
intra-patch and inter-patch movements, respectively. We applied this
approach using a radius of 250 m so that each GPS location is
associated with an estimate of the residence time, which corresponds
to the amount of time spent in the vicinity of any location
\citep{barraquand_animal_2008}. To measure movement speed, we
calculated the straight-line distance between consecutive GPS
locations and divided by the time elapsed. For estimating speed, we
excluded any data where the inter-fix interval was greater than 6
hours. Second, to describe intensity of activity for each individual
we used integrated activity sensors within the GPS collars and
expected an increase of activity, as already mentioned, of territorial
individuals so as to define and maintain a territory. These sensors
measure the frequency of head movements in the horizontal (X) and
vertical (Y) planes over each five minute interval. In order to link
the activity data with the location data in a comparable time series,
we aggregated the activity information across a six hour window
centred on each theoretical GPS location (\textit{i.e.} at 00:00,
06:00, 12:00 and 18:00). For example, for a location obtained at
06:00, we averaged activity data measured from 03:00 to 09:00
separately for both the X and Y axes. Due to missing activity data for
some individuals, the sample for head movements on the X axis and on
the Y axis comprised 52 and 168 individual age classes at BAV and AUR
respectively for 75\% of scheduled locations (or 35 and 85 for 90\% of
scheduled locations).

\section*{Statistical analyses}

Because territoriality and rut of males are quite hard to characterize
specifically on marked individuals, no behavioural field observations
were collected to be associated with the observed movement patterns
linked to these mating behaviours. We instead relied on the biological
fact that mainly adult males should engaged into reproduction, and
attempted to quantify the specificity of male movement and activity
patterns with regards to territorial and rutting behaviours as
follows. As a first step, we described the temporal variation in
movement and activity variables at the population level, and tested
for age and sex effects. This served as an \textit{a priori} analyses
of the metrics, testing for the differences between an average male
and female of varying ages. At this stage, we searched for some
particular patterns that would show up in adult males only. As a
second step, we ran an uninformed classification procedure aiming at
pooling \textit{a posteriori} in the same group individuals with
similar temporal variation of movement and activity variables. Because
territorial status was unknown, we therefore evaluated the composition
of these groups in terms of sex and age classes since only males are
expected to be territorial and mostly adults. Our approach assumed
that a high proportion of individuals of the same sex belonging to the
same group would be a sign of good discriminant power and ability to
infer one male's mating behaviour from movement and activity. Below we
detail the analyses we performed at the population and individual
levels.

\subsection*{At the population level}
To detect territorial and/or rutting behaviour, we compared the
movement and activity metrics of male and female juveniles, yearlings
and adults. Indeed, a priori, we expected to observe signals of
territorial behaviour in males but not females, and mostly in
prime-age males, rather than sub-adults or yearlings For the analysis,
we considered the animal’s age as it related to the rut, that is,
animals captured in winter as juveniles are yearling during the
subsequent rutting period (the second of their life), yearlings at
capture become sub-adults (third rut of their life), while adults at
capture remain adult during the subsequent rutting event.

We analysed the temporal patterns of the four metrics, \textit{i.e.}
residence time in a radius of 250 m (RT250), movement speed (speed),
mean head movements on the X axis (meanX) and on the Y axis
(meanY). We used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to model
these four dependant variables separately, including roe deer identity
as a random factor to control for repeated observations per
individual. We used GAMM rather than standard linear models because
GAMMs capture nonlinear temporal variation more efficiently. We used
cyclic P-splines to smooth the effect of time to account for the
cyclic pattern of the dependant variables over the year. Because day
length influences the ranging behaviour of roe deer
\citep{borger_integrated_2006}, we arbitrarily set the winter solstice
(December 22nd) as the common starting day (Julian date = 1) for both
study sites \cite[see also][]{morellet_seasonality_2013}. We included
sex (two modalities), age class (three modalities) and study site (two
modalities) as explanatory factors.

For each dependent variable separately, we compared five models: a
model containing only the spline of the Julian date (baseline model),
a model including a sex-specific temporal effect (i.e. a spline of
Julian date for each sex), a model including both a sex-specific and
age-specific temporal effect, a model including a sex-specific and a
site-specific temporal effect, and a model including a sex-specific,
age-specific and site-specific temporal effect. We systematically
included sex in all models other than the baseline model as there was
a strong a priori reason to expect the temporal pattern should differ
between sexes (see above). In order to improve the quality of the fit
of GAMM models and then to reduce the structure of residuals, we used
the Box-Cox power transformation of the four variables using the
boxcox function in the \textsf{MASS} library. We used the second order
Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample size
\citep[AICc,][]{burnham_model_1998} and Akaike weights ($w$) to select
the model with the most support among the set of five candidate models
constructed a priori. All generalized additive mixed models were
fitted using the \textsf{gamm} function in the \textsf{mgcv} library
\cite{wood_generalized_2006} in \textbf{\textsf{R}} software version
3.3.1 \citep{r_core_team_r:_2016}. As recommended by \cite{Wood2017}, we
selected the number of knots ($k$) of the penalized regression model
by comparing $k$ and the effective number of degrees of freedom
(\textit{edf}). As long as \textit{edf} was too close to $k$, we
sequentially increased the number of knots \citep{Wood2017}. Finally,
because the inclusion of non-sedentary animals might influence our
results we eliminated all individuals that were not classified as
sedentary following the approach described in
\cite{cagnacci_partial_2011} and then replicated the analyses to
evaluate the robustness of our results.

\subsection*{At the individual level}
To test whether we could discriminate territorial from non-territorial
male roe deer, we used an unsupervised clustering method based on the
three temporal metrics speed, meanX and meanY. We did not consider
RT250 at this stage as this metric was less informative than at
population level (see Results). We performed a hierarchical clustering
(ref\nico{Vincent?}, a classical technique that groups individuals together if they
present similar temporal metrics. This method requires a single
distance matrix computed on the basis of the three metrics:
consequently, for any pair of individuals, we computed the quadratic
mean of ($i$) the distance between the two speed metrics and ($ii$)
the distance between the two activity metrics (meanX and meanY taken
together) of this pair of individuals. Since the temporal metrics can
be highly fluctuating between subsequent locations, the distance
between the metrics of two individuals can be overestimated due to
irrelevant fine scale variations. To circumvent this issue, we
previously denoised and smoothed the temporal metrics one by one with
wavelets (from an original metrics, we retained the inverse discrete
wavelet transform with the lowest frequency levels as the metrics to
be considered in the clustering approach; R package
\textsf{wavethresh} REF=tps://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387759609)
and we standardized the metrics. From the hierarchical clustering
results, we deduced the partition of the individuals into two groups
of similar metrics.

The clustering methods returned two groups of individuals (see
Results), that we analyzed as binary response variable. We performed
generalized linear models with a logit link function to analyse the
probability of an individual to belong to group 1 in relation to sex
(male \textit{vs.} female), study site (AUR \textit{vs.} BAV) and age
class (yearlings, sub-adults and adults). As we expected to observe
the territorial behaviour mostly on adult roe deer and in order to
make sure we obtained the same results over the two sites, we included
also the three-way interactions between these sex, site and age class
(and all two-way interactions) in the most complex model. To perform
this unsupervised clustering method, we retained the 52 and 168
individuals age classes for BAV and AUR, respectively, with at least
75\% of the scheduled locations and the three temporal metrics (speed,
meanX and meanY). We performed our model selection with the second
order Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample
size. We used the \textit{dredge} function in the \textit{MuMIn}
library to generate all sets of models \citep{barton_mumin:_2016}.

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{At the population level}

Overall our results were robust with respect to sedentary status of
roe deer. Indeed, whether we restricted the analysis to sedentary
individuals only or analyzed all available individuals, the results
were comparable (see Electronic Appendix S1). Thus, we here present
results based on the whole data set to provide a more general picture.

Residence time (RT250), movement speed (speed), mean head movements on
the X axis (meanX) and on the Y axis (meanY) all showed strong
temporal variation that differed in amplitude, timing and general
pattern among sexes, age classes and study sites (AICc weight = 1,
Table~\ref{tab:population}). In males, except for residence time, the
temporal variation of the different metrics followed a comparable
pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:sex}). However, the temporal variation of the
four metrics differed markedly between adult males and females
(Fig.~\ref{fig:age}). Residence time of females showed a pronounced
peak around the birth period, whereas it was more or less constant for
males. The temporal fluctuations were generally consistent among the
different age-classes (Fig.~\ref{fig:age}).

For females, movement speed followed an inverted bell curve, and was
highest during winter and lowest near the summer solstice. However,
the temporal variations in actvity (head movements on the X and Y
axes) were not very consistent between the two study sites. In
contrast, for males, both movement speed and head movements (X and Y
axes) followed a bimodal distribution, with one peak in spring
(between the 3rd and 12th of April for AUR and the 16th of May for
BAV, Table \ref{tab:peaks}) and another peak in summer (between the
29th of July and 13th of August for AUR between the 12th and 30th of
July for BAV, Table \ref{tab:peaks}). Finally, there was a better
consistency between head movements on the X and Y axes and between
study sites (with one peak in spring between the 11th and 12th of
April for AUR and the 16th of May for BAV, and another peak in summer
the 29th of July for AUR and between the 29th and 30th of July for
BAV, Table \ref{tab:peaks}).

\subsection*{At the individual level}
From the hierarchical clustering performed separately for each study
site on movement speed and head movements (meanX+meanY), for each
study site we retained two clusters of individuals that showed
comparable temporal patterns (see Electronic Appendix S2)\nico{To do  Vincent?}. One cluster
included all individuals that had two temporal peaks for movement
speed and head movements (cluster 2), the other cluster contained
individuals that showed an inverted bell curve in movement speed (with
a higher speed during winter than during summer) and only one temporal
peak (see Electronic Appendix S2). In the next step, we thus
considered individuals with two pronounced activity peaks as those
most likely to be engaged in territorial behaviour. In the analysis of
the sex-, study site- and age- dependence of this behaviour, the best
model describing the probability of having two activity peaks
contained only the two-way interaction between age and sex (AICc
weight = 0.25, Table \ref{tab:probability},
Fig.~\ref{fig:probability}). The probability of having two activity
peaks was much lower for adult females (0.016$\pm$0.016) than for
adult males (0.852$\pm$0.048).

\section*{Discussion}

Males and females of the same species often display contrasting mating
related behaviours \citep{clutton-brock_red_1982, lott_intraspecific_1984}. Even if the
roe deer is oligomorphic and present a small sexual size dimorphism
only \citep{andersen_social_1998}, adult males show an unusually extended period of
reproduction-related behaviour for a large herbivore. Male roe deer
start with territoriality in early spring to the end of rut by late
August \citep{bramley_1970}. Two peaks of activity and speed associated to a reduced residence time seem to characterize the seasonal patterns of male behaviour, consistently matching across populations with the expected timing of territoriality and mating of roe deer \citep{bramley_1970}. Given
the high sex-specificity of this temporal covariation between movement
and activity (Table~\ref{tab:peaks}), we suggest that the occurrence
and timing of territoriality and rut of male roe deer maybe assessed indirectly from bio-logging data at the population level, and at the individual level as well.

  \subsection*{Using GPS data to infer on male behaviour}

  Territoriality is usually defines as "\ldots \textit{an individual or group of mutually tolerant individuals actively excludes competitors from a specific resource or resources.}" \citep{maher_review_2000}. Holding a territory implies repeated aggressive behaviours, in the same location, inducing submissive behavioural responses from recipient of the aggression \citep{pyke_territoriality_1996}. Because territoriality and rut last in time, involves furtive interactions between several animals, and cannot be deduced from one single specific behaviour, we lacked such field observations of male reproductive behaviour to compare with the observed activity and movement patterns. The inference of territoriality and of rut from GPS data hence remains uncertain. To circumvent this problem, we relied on the expected reproductive behaviour of roe deer according to their age and sex, and an uninformed classification of individual temporal patterns to assess our method. At the individual level, the grouping of all males in the same group based on activity and movement seasonal patterns would strongly suggest that this behaviour is tightly linked  to territoriality and rut. Similarly, if adult males 2 years and older can be differentiated from yearlings, which we assumed not to engage into reproduction, based on activity and movements this would reinforce the robustness of our inference.

  As expected our clustering method could clearly sort out male from female roe deer with an average accuracy of 84.1\% of males belonging to the same group defined \textit{a posteriori} by the classification method. The percentage of correct sex assignment varied with age, being higher for adults (92.2\%) than for yearlings (71.6\%) which activity and movement patterns were very different from those of females. Although not perfect, the percentage of individuals with a correct sex assignment is comparable to the predictive power reported for relocation-based methods to infer on parturition date for reindeer \citep[80\% on average,][]{bonar_implementing_2018, cameron_movement-based_2018}. The presence of two peaks (activity or speed) or of two valleys (retention time) at the expected time of territoriality and rut seems to be the main signature of mature males compared to females, a feature that also discriminate males of different age-classes. We could find no such peaks in the activity of adult females. Because of the high sex- and age-specificity of these marked seasonal changes in activity and movement at the time of territoriality and rut, we conclude that GPS and activity data contains a signal of mating behaviour of male roe deer.

In favor of this interpretation, the two extremum in activity and movement of male roe deer strongly suggests that these seasonal changes, associated with territoriality and rut, are under control of the endocrine system. The increasing activity and mobility of males closely follows the reported pattern of circulating testosterone in roe deer \citep{sempere_influence_1992}. Mirroring the initial rise of testosterone in February, male become more active and move more rapidly in March reaching a peak in early April at Aurignac for instance (Table~\ref{tab:peaks}). The settlement of a territory appears progressive and gradual in roe deer. The following drop in activity and movement we evidence in June for both populations (Fig.~\ref{fig:sex} \& ~\ref{fig:age}) has also been reported in the marking behaviour of male roe deer in the time interval between territoriality and rut in Scandinavia \citep{johansson_functional_1996, andersen_mating_1998}. Similarly, the level of circulating testosterone does also decrease in May  \citep{sempere_influence_1992}, matching with the lower activity and mobility we found. From early July testosterone level of male roe deer climbs rapidly to its whole-year maximum in early August. Activity, speed and retention time again reach their extremum accordingly. Overall the seasonal patterns in activity and mobility of males recorded by the embarked loggers likely captures temporal variation in the number of reproduction-related behaviours like rubbing, scrapping or fighting, which frequency of display and intensity are primarily dictated by levels of circulating testosterone \citep{miller_dominance_1987, hau_regulation_2007}.

%Obviously, male roe deer seem to allocate a substantial amount of time to rubbing and scrapping.

\subsection*{Territoriality}

Territoriality is a mating strategy of mature males that should emerge
when the defense of an area encompassing several female home ranges is
energetically sustainable \citep{emlen_ecology_1977}. Recent theoretical models linking territorial behaviour and animal movements predict a central place forager type of movements
\citep{potts_territorial_2012}. In other words, territorial individuals
should return regularly to a core area where they spend most of their
time. In contrast with the central place forager hypothesis, male roe
deer spend less time at the same place because residence time
decreases with territoriality (Fig.~\ref{fig:sex}). The seasonal movement pattern we describe for roe deer is more in line with previous empirical observations proposing that the ranging behaviour of males is similar during and outside the territoriality period \citep{andersen_mating_1998}. Male roe deer do not seem to patrol at the periphery of their territory but occupy space by covering physically the defended area by moving faster and staying less time at the same location.

Territory marking in male roe deer consists of rubbing twigs and scraping the ground, which could convey scent cues to competitors and potential mates thanks to skin glands \citep{johansson_functional_1996}. Consistent with this long-lasting observation, we detect a higher activity for males during the expected time window for territoriality in both sites although it occurs 26 days earlier in Aurignac than in Bavaria (Table~\ref{tab:peaks}). Our result hence point toward the idea that some phenotypic plasticity is possible in the timing of roe deer territoriality. A first explanation could be that because of the generally late snow cover in Northern Bavaria (until mi-April), rubbing and scrapping become inefficient in terms of odor signalling and visual clues hence delaying the timing of territoriality compared to Aurignac. Alternatively, males territorial behaviour may respond to day length, which is 27 minute shorter in Bavaria than in Aurignac by early February when male activity starts to increase in France. In their study of roe deer seasonal endocrine pattern, \cite{andersen_reproductive_1998} mention that, at the time of territoriality, testosterone could start to rise one month earlier in France (Chizé) than in Germany (Walchensee, Bavaria\kris{Marco, could you find out the location?}\nico{Location could be Walchensee according to Barth, D., Giménez, T., Hoffmann, B., Karg, H., 1976. Testosteronkonzentrationen im peripheren Blut beim Rehbock (Capreolus capreolus): Saisonale und rhythmische Veränderungen sowie Beziehungen zu einigen Verhaltensweisen und anderen saisonabhängigen Parametern. Zeitschrift für Jagdwissenschaft 22, 134–148. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01906783
}). Although the temporal resolution of these two studies is coarse compared to our data, this physiological observation strengthens our interpretation that activity and movement data reflect territorial behaviour of male roe deer, both which could be governed by day length.

Age is another important structuring variable of mating behaviour in large herbivores because young males may not be physiologically mature yet or may be prevented to access to reproduction by older males \citep{clutton-brock_red_1982}. In roe deer, territory marking should be less frequent for yearlings but much more common for males 2yrs and older \citep{johansson_functional_1996}, a prediction supported by the percentage of males displaying two peaks of activity in the year (Table~\ref{tab:probability}). Assuming that the activity level of individuals increases with marking and rubbing, territorial behaviour we assessed from activity records appears less intense for male roe deer younger than 3 at Aurignac than for older ones. In contrast, the peak of activity increased more gradually from yearlings to adults in the Bavarian Forest population (Fig.~\ref{fig:age}). In agro-system like Aurignac, young males may not engage into reproduction because of the high roe deer density and hence, the high inter-male competition \citep{hewison_using_2007}. In response to aggressive behaviours from territorial adults, young males disperse from their natal area \citep{wahlstrom_patterns_1995}, thereby postponing the acquisition of a territory. Some technical issues could also explain the marked difference in activity between sites because collar brand was different at AUR and BAV and on-board activity loggers may not record activity exactly in the same way. However, even if the absolute values cannot be compared between the two sites, we have defined maximums in activity at both sites and we believe that we were able to capture relative variation in activity between those sites.

\subsection*{Rut}

In roe deer, rutting males chase away any competitor and actively search for females. They also maintain territory marking with rubbing and scrapping. In sharp contrast with territoriality, the timing of rut seems rather constrained temporally. Peaks of activity of males occurred on July 29th during rut in France and Germany, while it was observed one month earlier in France during territoriality (April 11th vs. May 16th). Unlike territoriality which may depend on the internal state of males, the timing of rut is more likely to be triggered by the presence of ovulating females. At the population level, female roe deer are relatively synchronous in parturition dates with 80\% of births in a 3-weeks time window \citep{plard_parturition_2013}. Assuming a low heterogeneity in gestation length among females, ovulation dates are likely to be as synchronous which is consistent with the limited duration of rut we observe (approx. 30 days, see Fig.\ref{fig:sex}). More importantly, the average parturition date is strikingly similar across years because the main environmental cue used by females to start reproducing is day length \citep{plard_mismatch_2014}. As a result females may ovulate at the same time across populations, and so is the rut of males. We hence expect the timing of rut to be much less variable in time and space for roe deer than for other large herbivores like the red deer \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{bonenfant_multiple_2004}.

According to our classification, roe deer could rut during their second year of life more often than anticipated. Alternatively, young roe deer may be chased away and harassed by rutting adults thereby increasing their activity, explaining the less marked peak of activity of yearlings at the time of territoriality compared to more mature males (Fig.~\ref{fig:age}).

\subsection*{Conclusion}
Reproduction has strong effect on animals, driving movement and
activity patterns. Except for a few species with particularly
conspicuous rutting behaviour like the red deer, much less is known
in large herbivores about the individual variation in the timing
and frequency of territoriality and rut for males compared to our
current knowledge on female reproduction. Among the different variables we investigated, the signals for territoriality and rut were clearer from activity
than movement data. Because of its possible link with field metabolic rate \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{Gremillet_2018}\kris{Alors dans le papier ils utilisent l'accélérométrie, ce qui n'est pas notre cas. Or l'accélérométrie traduit vraiment une dépense d'énergie}, the duration and relative increase in activity could serve as proxy of the energy allocation of males into reproduction. Our results hence open the way to the detailed study of reproductive behaviour of male roe deer at the individual level and, for instance, to test for the effect of body mass, antler size or habitat quality on the timing and duration of territoriality and rut in roe deer, and how these choices can affect male reproductive success\nico{notamment on pourrait tester plusieurs des hypothèses proposées par Wahlström 2013 sur la défense du territorie comme un ornement sexuel}. Possibly the method could apply to other males of forest-dwelling species like the mule deer or white-tailed deer \species{odocoileus virginianus} for which reproductive behaviour is expected to affect their movement and activity \citep{relyea_activity_1994, foley_reproductive_2018}.

\nicoin{et si on ouvre encore un peu sur les différences individuelles et le succès reproducteur des mâles, le bio-logging pourrait être un outil pour d'autres espèces pour appréhender, détecter des comportements qui étaient jusque là indetectables ou in-observables. Par exemple, avec l'accélérométrie on devrait être en mesure de détecter des comportements plus fins encore, exple les aggressions, peut-être les coïts et permettre d'étudier les liens entre tactiques individuelles, qualité phénotypique et succès reproducteur...}
