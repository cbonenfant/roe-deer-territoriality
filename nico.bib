                  animals have to move through various types of areas
                  that are more or less suitable with respect to their
                  current needs. The locations of the pro. table
                  places actually used, which may be only a subset of
                  the whole set of suitable areas available, are
                  usually unknown, but can be inferred from movement
                  analysis by assuming that these places correspond to
                  the limited areas where the animals spend more time
                  than elsewhere. Identifying these intensively used
                  areas makes it possible, through subsequent
                  analyses, to address both how they are distributed
                  with respect to key habitat features, and the
                  underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these
                  areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically
                  reviewed the few previously published methods to
                  detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur
                  when an animal enters a pro. table place. As all of
                  them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific
                  situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method
                  based on the time spent in the vicinity of
                  successive path locations. We used computer
                  simulations to show that our method is both quite
                  general and robust to noisy data.},

                  ecological research. However, how and why home range
                  size varies between individuals is not well studied
                  or understood for most species. We develop a
                  hierarchical analytical approach-using generalized
                  linear mixed-effects modeling of time series of home
                  range sizes- that allows variance in home range size
                  to be decomposed into components due to variation in
                  temporal, spatial, and individual-level processes,
                  also facilitating intra-and interspecific
                  comparative analyses. We applied the approach to
                  data from a roe deer population radiotracked in
                  central Italy. Over multiple timescales, temporal
                  variation is explained by photoperiod and climate
                  and spatial variation by the distribution of habitat
                  types and spatial variance in radio-tracking
                  error. Differences between individuals explained a
                  substantial amount of variance in home range size,
                  but only a relatively minor part was explained by
                  the individual attributes of sex and age. We
                  conclude that the choice of temporal scale at which
                  data are collected and the definition of home range
                  can significantly influence biological inference. We
                  suggest that the appropriate choice of scale and
                  definition requires a good understanding of the
                  ecology and life history of the study species. Our
                  findings contrast with several common assumptions
                  about roe deer behavior.},

                  allows us to monitor and to map the details of
                  animal movement, securing vast quantities of such
                  data even for highly cryptic organisms. We envision
                  an exciting synergy between animal ecology and
                  GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of
                  new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual
                  advances, where research opportunities have been
                  paralleled by technical and analytical
                  challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental
                  unit of movement paths and show where individuals
                  interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss
                  how knowing where animals go can help scientists in
                  their search for a mechanistic understanding of key
                  concepts of animal ecology, including resource use,
                  home range and dispersal, and population
                  dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant
                  future, intense sampling of movements coupled with
                  detailed information on habitat features at a
                  variety of scales will allow us to represent an
                  animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the
                  intimate relationship between behaviour and
                  fitness. An extended use of these data over long
                  periods of time and over large spatial scales can
                  provide robust inferences for complex,
                  multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of
                  the effects of climate change on animal behaviour
                  and distribution.},

  abstract     = {The energetic costs and the risk of injury in
                  agonistic encounters can be reduced by prior
                  .isse\$sment of opponents: it will generally pay low
                  quality animals to avoid combat with onc of high
                  quality. Following this principle it is suggested
                  that territory owners scent mark rheir territories
                  to provide intruders with a ineaiis of
                  :issessnient. When the odour of a competitor, or of
                  a mark it is seen t o have made, matches that of
                  scent marks encountered in the vicinity, then the
                  competitor is probably the territory owner. Since
                  owners are generally hifih quality animals, and
                  assuming they have more to gain by retaining a
                  territory than an intrudcr h.is in taking it over,
                  it will pay the owner to escalate and the intruder
                  to give up early. The advantage to owners in
                  markin:; may thus be that by allowing themselves to
                  be identified they reduce the costs of territory
                  defence. Published information on the behaviour of
                  territory owners and intruders is consistent with
                  predictions from this hypothesis. The hypothesis
                  offers an explanation for a number of poorly

  abstract     = {In species in which males defend territories for
                  breeding, males may differ in territorial behavior;
                  alternative behaviors among territorial males are
                  not well understood. In our long-term study of
                  partially-migratory song sparrows, we have observed
                  that most territorial males establish territories
                  before females begin nesting and remain
                  site-faithful both within and between breeding
                  seasons; however, some males establish territories
                  later in the season (late establishers) and/or
                  change territory locations either within or between
                  seasons (movers). Whether late establishment or
                  moving are equally successful strategies for
                  territory defense, or best-of-bad-job options, is
                  not known. Here, we compare the frequencies of these
                  behaviors to demographic variables over a 9-yr
                  period and compare lifetime tenure and early season
                  nesting success for males who differ in site
                  fidelity and timing of territory
                  establishment. Across years, late establishing was
                  negatively correlated with the return rate of
                  previously territorial males; moving was positively
                  correlated with the number of occupied territories
                  at the start of the breeding season (territory
                  density). While moving was independent of number of
                  years on territory, late territory establishment
                  only occurred in a male's first year as a territory
                  holder. Of 88 males, 25\% established their first
                  territory late, primarily in undefended space; 31\%
                  moved. Late and early establishers did not differ in
                  lifetime tenure; movers, however, had longer
                  lifetime tenure than site-faithful males. Among
                  early establishers, movers and non-movers did not
                  differ in the number of successful early nests/year
                  or number of young fledged/year; among late
                  establishers, however, movers had significantly
                  higher early nesting success by both measures. Late
                  establishers who moved had higher early season
                  nesting success and higher early season nesting
                  success/year than site-faithful early
                  establishers. Thus, individual variation in the
                  timing of territory establishment and site fidelity
                  may be facultative alternative territorial
                  strategies.},

                  these advances have been accompanied by the
                  development of new methods of data analysis for
                  portraying space use, home ranges and utilization
                  distributions. New statistical approaches include
                  data-intensive techniques such as kriging and
                  nonlinear generalized regression models for habitat
                  use. In addition, mechanistic home-range models,
                  derived from models of animal movement behaviour,
                  promise to offer new insights into how home ranges

                  movements by individuals in response to their
                  environment. Traditional methods such as kernel
                  density estimators are likely to remain popular
                  because of their ease of use. Large datasets make it
                  possible to apply these methods over relatively
                  short periods of time such as weeks or months, and
                  these estimates may be analysed using mixed effects
                  models, offering another approach to studying
                  temporal variation in space-use patterns. Although
                  new technologies open new avenues in ecological
                  research, our knowledge of why animals use space in
                  the ways we observe will only advance by researchers
                  using these new technologies and asking new and

  abstract     = {1. It is widely accepted that the arrival order of
                  migratory birds is correlated with the condition of
                  the birds, which leads to high quality individuals
                  occupying prime sites. However, the theoretical
                  backgrounds for this argument have been lacking. A
                  simple game-theoretic model of arrival timing is
                  provided which investigates the evolutionary
                  stability of condition-dependent arrival order in
                  territorial migrant birds. 2. Competition for
                  territories or other priority-dependent benefits can
                  lead to arrival dates far preceding the
                  cost-minimizing date (the optimum date in the
                  absence of competition) for all but the weakest
                  individuals. Increasing the number of competitors
                  can generate a ‘cascading’ competition for early
                  arrival, which advances arrival dates further apart
                  from the individual optimum dates for the onset of
                  breeding. 3. At equilibrium, arrival order
                  corresponds strictly to condition order only if
                  marginal costs of advancing arrival are always
                  larger for individuals in lower condition. If spring
                  mortality vacates territories for later-arriving
                  birds, the criterion for ‘honest’ arrival order
                  becomes still stricter: differential survival costs
                  should exist, but survival differences among
                  individuals (or, alternatively, territory quality
                  differences) should not be very large. 4. If the
                  habitat is saturated so that there is a risk of not
                  obtaining a territory at all, or if worst
                  territories are of much lower value than the rest,
                  competition may lead to the majority of the
                  population arriving within a fairly short interval,
                  followed by a much later floating fraction. This
                  synchrony in the arrival of breeders imposes an
                  increasing cost for the lesser fit breeding
                  birds. Thus, arrival costs paid are not necessarily
                  highest for earliest arriving individuals, but for
                  those who have the most to lose if they drop a few
                  steps in the arrival order. 5. Competition for high
                  quality territories can also lead to partial
                  migration, in which case birds in good condition are
                  expected to be most likely to remain resident.},

  abstract     = {Both species and populations within species display
                  variation in spacing patterns, and the number of
                  published reports documenting this variation is
                  increasing rapidly. The potential for instructive
                  comparisons is high, but the comparative approach
                  requires common terminology. Vague or implicit
                  definitions of spacing systems undermine the rigour
                  of comparisons. Papers were reviewed that examined
                  interspecific and intraspecific variation in spacing
                  systems to determine the degree to which definitions
                  currently produce a common terminology. This report
                  describes and classifies the 48 conceptual and
                  operational definitions of territoriality found in
                  the literature. Only 12\% of the papers gave an
                  operational definition of territoriality. The single
                  criterion of ‘defended area’ was used in 50\% of the
                  papers, and the other 50\% used other definitions
                  which often consisted of multiple criteria. These
                  definitions were variants of three main themes:
                  defended area, exclusive area, and site-specific
                  dominance, and authors used up to three criteria to
                  define territoriality. Conceptual and operational
                  definitions differed because different questions
                  were asked and because of logistical problems, such
                  as collecting the same data on different species or
                  populations. The taxonomic group being studied also
                  seemed to determine which type of definition was
                  chosen. Although defended area was used most often
                  across four classes of vertebrates, researchers
                  studying mammals chose spatial criteria, for
                  example, amount of home range overlap, more often
                  than researchers studying other taxa. Workers
                  pursuing research in this area can enhance their
                  contribution by using clear conceptual and
                  operational definitions of territoriality, making
                  them explicit at the outset.},

                  enclosure. The animals (three young males, four
                  adult females) were monitored with GPS telemetry
                  collars. As expected, the surface area and overlap
                  of the males' bimonthly ranges decreased, and the
                  distance between their arithmetic centres increased,
                  as they became adult and, for two of them,
                  territorial. Unexpectedly, females also tended to
                  space out, the surface area and overlap of their
                  bimonthly ranges being minimal in May to June,
                  i.e. during the birth period. The distance between
                  their arithmetic centres reached its maximum at the
                  same time. Overlap between females' ranges was
                  consistently lower than those between males and
                  females' ranges, or between 1-year old males'
                  ranges. Our results raise the questions of female
                  seasonal territoriality and of independence of the

  abstract     = {Locating and monitoring animals using tracking
                  devices is a method commonly used for many taxa to
                  study characteristics Such as home-range size,
                  habitat selection, movement patterns and other
                  aspects of ranging behaviour. Fitting such devices
                  requires the capture and handling of the study
                  organism and researchers must then assume that a
                  monitored animal behaves in a 'normal' way. We
                  investigated whether the capture and handling of roe
                  deer Capreolus capreolus induced behavioural
                  alterations. In particular, we expected that the roe
                  deer would exhibit a 'seeking a refuge and waiting
                  before returning' strategy immediately after
                  release, taking shelter far from the capture scene,
                  in closed habitat, and exhibiting a reduced activity
                  level. We evaluated the effect of capture and
                  handling on 112 roe deer equipped with GPS collars,
                  during a period of 50 days after release. We
                  compared the first 10 days after release with the
                  subsequent days for the following behavioural
                  parameters: distance to the barycentre of their GPS
                  fixes, presence in forest habitat, distance to the
                  nearest forest patch, distance to a source of human
                  disturbance, and activity level. We found pronounced
                  differences in terms of spatial behaviour, habitat
                  use and overall activity level between the two
                  periods in GPS monitored roe deer. We also found
                  differences in terms of spatial displacement between
                  the sexes, with females responding less than males,
                  and among age classes, with yearlings responding
                  most and fawns least, to the capture and handling
                  event. Finally, spatial displacement of roe deer
                  increased with openness of the habitat due, in part,
                  to the scarcity of available shelter in open
                  areas. We conclude that the roe deer exhibited a
                  strategy consisting of seeking a refuge and waiting
                  before returning after capture, handling and fitting
                  of a collar, with displacement towards a refuge
                  habitat, in or near woodland, avoidance of sources
                  of human disturbance and reduced activity
                  levels. From a practical point of view, we recommend
                  removing data during the first days of monitoring as
                  behavioural alterations due to capture and handling
                  may be pronounced.},

  abstract     = {Despite widespread interest in territorial behavior,
                  the processes by which animals establish territories
                  are still poorly understood. We present a new
                  learning-based model of territory establishment for
                  species in which individuals set up territories
                  within large patches of spatially heterogeneous
                  habitat. The model is based on the simple
                  assumptions that individuals tend to return to areas
                  in which they previously had rewarding experiences
                  and, conversely, tend to avoid areas in which they
                  previously engaged in costly aggressive
                  interactions. The literature on learning and
                  territorial establishment suggests that these
                  assumptions are probably valid for many
                  animals. Individual-based, spatially-explicit
                  simulations of settlement behavior incorporating the
                  assumptions of this model generate a number of
                  phenomena comparable to those observed in
                  territorial animals, including the formation of
                  stable home ranges within large patches of uniform
                  quality habitat, increases in territory size and
                  home range exclusivity if settlers interact
                  aggressively with one another, greater benefits of
                  aggressive behavior if individuals settle at high
                  density than if they settle at low density, higher
                  success for residents when they compete with
                  newcomers for the same space (the "prior residency
                  advantage"), and the avoidance by newcomers of areas
                  used by previous residents. Although the model needs
                  further refinement to generate some phenomena
                  observed in territorial species, our results suggest
                  that the processes responsible for generating
                  several basic components of territorial behavior may
                  be simpler than is currently supposed.},

                  territorial ungulate, the European roe deer
                  (Capreolus capreolus). YBS in both populations was
                  markedly age-structured, with 3 distinct stages,
                  supporting the dome-shaped pattern of variation
                  commonly reported for age-dependent variation in
                  life-history traits of ungulates. YBS was low at 2
                  years of age, peaked at 3–8 years of age, and tended
                  to decline afterwards (senescence). Most males
                  successfully reproduced for the 1st time at 3 years
                  of age, which is well after their physiological
                  maturity. The few successful young males (i.e., 2
                  year olds) were likely fast-growing individuals that
                  could successfully hold a territory. The high

                  Bogesund, Sweden, suggests that only some males of

                  tend to have highly polygynous mating systems
                  associated with high variance in male lifetime
                  reproductive success (LRS), leading to a high
                  opportunity for sexual selection. However, little
                  information is available for species with weak
                  sexual size dimorphism. In a long-term study
                  population, we used parentage analysis based on 21
                  microsatellite markers to describe, for the first
                  time, variance in male lifetime breeding success
                  (LBS) of roe deer, a territorial ungulate where
                  males weigh less than 10\% more than females. LBS
                  ranged from 0 to 14 (mean = 4.54, variance = 15.5),
                  and its distribution was highly skewed, with only a
                  few males obtaining high LBS and many males failing
                  to breed or siring only one fawn. As predicted for
                  polygynous species with low sexual size dimorphism,
                  the standardized variance in male LBS was low (I-m =
                  0.75) and was only slightly higher than the
                  standardized variance in female LRS (I-f = 0.53),
                  suggesting a low opportunity for sexual
                  selection. The I-m value reported here for roe deer
                  is much lower than values reported for highly
                  dimorphic ungulates such as red deer (I-m
                  {\textgreater} 3). We suggest that, along a
                  continuum of opportunity for sexual selection, roe
                  deer occupy a position closer to monogamous and
                  monomorphic territorial ungulates than to highly
                  polygynous, sexually dimorphic ungulates with
                  dominance rank-based mating systems such as harems
                  or roving mating systems.},

                  absent in male bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus but a
                  minority has suggested that some exclusive
                  mechanisms act between adult males. This study
                  provides indirect evidence for the existence of
                  territorial structures between adult male bushbuck
                  by comparing home-range overlap between adult and
                  sub-adult males. The spatial organization of
                  individuals in relation to each other was
                  established by using numerical
                  classiﬁcation. Location ﬁxes of 52 males, each
                  individual distinguished by a characteristic coat
                  pattern, were taken over a period of 3 years. Home
                  ranges were estimated using the ﬁxed kernel density
                  estimator. Two indices (coefﬁcient of overlap, index
                  of overlap) were applied to compare home-range
                  overlap between the different male age
                  classes. There was a strong home-range overlap up to
                  the 30\% home-range core between sub-adult as well
                  as between adult and sub-adult males, while adult
                  male home ranges overlapped up to the 50\%
                  home-range core only. It could be shown that home
                  ranges of adult males overlapped signiﬁcantly less
                  than those of sub-adult males and those between
                  sub-adult and adult males indicating an exclusive
                  use of central core areas (home sites). Sub-adult
                  males form bachelor pools without being permanently
                  associated. With increasing age, sub-adult males
                  challenge territory holders and replace them in
                  order to take over their exclusive areas. These
                  maturing sub-adult males (young adults), often
                  focused on a particular territory holder denoting
                  the young adults as prospects or candidates.},

	abstract = {Long-distance migrations by ungulate species are a globally imperiled natural phenomenon and conservation of them requires monitoring population vital rates. Satellite telemetry tracking is widely used for understanding the spatial distribution and movement of animals, especially migratory animals in remote environments. Recently, analytical methods have been developed to infer parturition events from movement data in multiple species that calve in isolation, but to date such methods have not been tested on animals that both migrate and spatially aggregate during calving. We applied two movement-based methods developed to infer parturition in nonmigratory woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) to 241 reproductive seasons spanning 6 years of GPS data from migratory barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti J.A. Allen, 1902). We compared results from both methods to data from aerial surveys of collared females during the calving period. We found that each movement-based method had ϳ80\% overall accuracy to identify calving events, with interannual variation ranging from 61\% to 100\%. When we considered instances when the two analytical methods agreed on parturition outcome, the accuracy increased to 89\% with an annual range of 73\%–100\%. Using these methods, we identiﬁed marked interannual differences in peak calving dates and higher parturition rates than previously reported for this caribou herd. The successful application of these analyses to a migratory, gregarious ungulate suggests a broader applicability of the methodology.},

	abstract = {The negative co-variation of life-history traits such as fecundity and lifespan across species suggests the existence of ubiquitous trade-offs. Mechanistically, trade-offs result from the need to differentially allocate limited resources to traits like reproduction versus selfmaintenance, with selection favoring the evolution of optimal allocation mechanism. Here I discuss the physiological (endocrine) mechanisms that underlie optimal allocation rules and how such rules evolve. The hormone testosterone may mediate life-history trade-offs due to its pleiotropic actions in male vertebrates. Conservation in the actions of testosterone in vertebrates has prompted the ‘evolutionary constraint hypothesis,’ which assumes that testosterone signaling mechanisms and male traits evolve as a unit. This hypothesis implies that the actions of testosterone are similar across sexes and species, and only the levels of circulating testosterone concentrations change during evolution. In contrast, the ‘evolutionary potential hypothesis’ proposes that testosterone signaling mechanisms and male traits evolve independently. In the latter scenario, the linkage between hormone and traits itself can be shaped by selection, leading to variation in trade-off functions. I will review recent case studies supporting the evolutionary potential hypothesis and suggest micro-evolutionary experiments to unravel the mechanistic basis of lifehistory evolution.

	abstract = {Uncovering the mechanisms behind territory formation is a fundamental problem in behavioural ecology. The broad nature of the underlying conspecific avoidance processes are well documented across a wide range of taxa. Scent marking in particular is common to a large range of terrestrial mammals and is known to be fundamental for communication. However, despite its importance, exact quantification of the time-scales over which scent cues and messages persist remains elusive. Recent work by the present authors has begun to shed light on this problem by modelling animals as random walkers with scent-mediated interaction processes. Territories emerge as dynamic objects that continually change shape and slowly move without settling to a fixed location. As a consequence, the utilisation distribution of such an animal results in a slowly increasing home range, as shown for urban foxes (Vulpes vulpes). For certain other species, however, home ranges reach a stable state. The present work shows that stable home ranges arise when, in addition to scent-mediated conspecific avoidance, each animal moves as a central place forager. That is, the animal’s movement has a random aspect but is also biased towards a fixed location, such as a den or nest site. Dynamic territories emerge but the probability distribution of the territory border locations reaches a steady state, causing stable home ranges to emerge from the territorial dynamics. Approximate analytic expressions for the animal’s probability density function are derived. A programme is given for using these expressions to quantify both the strength of the animal’s movement bias towards the central place and the time-scale over which scent messages persist. Comparisons are made with previous theoretical work modelling central place foragers with conspecific avoidance. Some insights into the mechanisms behind allometric scaling laws of animal space use are also given.},

	abstract = {Sexual segregation outside the mating season occurs in most species of sexually dimorphic ungulates and has been extensively described in the literature, but the mechanisms causing segregation are still debated. The detailed pattern of sexual segregation throughout the year has rarely been presented for mammals, and no study, to our knowledge, has used latitudinal-related variation in breeding phenology to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Recent methodological developments have made it possible to quantify separate components of segregation (social, habitat) and activity synchrony in animal groups, but these major improvements have so far been little used. We observed European red deer year round at two widely different latitudes (France and Norway) and tested three different mechanistic hypotheses of segregation related to: (i) predation risk; (ii) body-size-related forage selection; and (iii) activity budget. Habitat segregation peaked during calving in both populations and dropped rapidly after calving. Females with calves were more segregated from males than were females without calves, pointing to a key role of antipredator behavior even though large predators are absent in France and extremely rare in Norway. However, at both sites individuals also grouped with their own sex within habitat types (i.e. social segregation), and individuals in mixed-sex groups were less synchronized in activity type than individuals in either unisex male or unisex female groups, suggesting that differences in activity budgets are involved. Social segregation peaked during calving and was lowest during the rut (indicating aggregation) in both populations; these activities occurred one month later in the Northern populations, corresponding well with known differences in breeding phenology. We conclude that latitude-dependent breeding phenology shapes the seasonal pattern of sexual segregation and that sexual segregation in ungulates has multiple causes.},

	abstract = {Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition.},

We quantified the repeatability of parturition date for individual females in five populations of roe deer, which we found to vary between 0.54 and 0.93. Each year, some females gave birth consistently earlier in the year, whereas others gave birth consistently later. In addition, all females followed the same lifetime trajectory for parturition date, giving birth progressively earlier as they aged. Giving birth early should allow mothers to increase offspring survival, although few females managed to do so.

	abstract = {Many felid species are endangered because of destructive human activities. As a result, zoos are being tasked with sustaining genetically healthy populations in case of catastrophic extinctions. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few species, most felids do not reproduce well in captivity. The ability to track reproductive activity via hormones is key to developing successful ex situ breeding programs. Through the development of noninvasive fecal hormone monitoring techniques, a high degree of variability in estrous cycle characteristics has been found to exist across the taxon, including the type of ovulation. For example, although all felids have induced ovulations, the occurrence of spontaneous ovulations varies across species, and even between individuals within a species. Clouded leopards, ﬁshing cats and margays frequently have spontaneous ovulations, whereas these are rarely observed in the cheetah, tigrina and ocelot. There are marked species differences in the impact of season on reproductive function, with some being exquisitely sensitive to photoperiod (e.g., Pallas’ cat), some moderately affected (tiger, clouded leopard, snow leopard), and others that are not inﬂuenced at all (e.g., ocelot, tigrina, margay, lion, leopard, ﬁshing cat). One of the greatest challenges remaining is overcoming the problems associated with highly variable ovarian responses to ovulation induction therapies used with assisted reproductive procedures, like artiﬁcial insemination (AI). Success is relatively high in the cheetah and ocelot, but few pregnancies have resulted after AI in clouded leopard, ﬁshing cat and tiger. Current knowledge of the reproductive physiology of nondomestic felids, including aspects of the anatomy, behavior and ovarian cycles will be presented, and how the rapidly growing endocrine database is aiding ex situ management efforts.},

	abstract = {In the last thirty years, the emergence and progression of biologging technology has led to great advances in marine predator ecology. Large databases of location and dive observations from biologging devices have been compiled for an increasing number of diving predator species (such as pinnipeds, sea turtles, seabirds and cetaceans), enabling complex questions about animal activity budgets and habitat use to be addressed. Central to answering these questions is our ability to correctly identify and quantify the frequency of essential behaviours, such as foraging. Despite technological advances that have increased the quality and resolution of location and dive data, accurately interpreting behaviour from such data remains a challenge, and analytical methods are only beginning to unlock the full potential of existing datasets. This review evaluates both traditional and emerging methods and presents a starting platform of options for future studies of marine predator foraging ecology, particularly from location and two-dimensional (time-depth) dive data. We outline the different devices and data types available, discuss the limitations and advantages of commonly-used analytical techniques, and highlight key areas for future research. We focus our review on pinnipeds - one of the most studied taxa of marine predators - but offer insights that will be applicable to other air-breathing marine predator tracking studies. We highlight that traditionally-used methods for inferring foraging from location and dive data, such as first-passage time and dive shape analysis, have important caveats and limitations depending on the nature of the data and the research question. We suggest that more holistic statistical techniques, such as state-space models, which can synthesise multiple track, dive and environmental metrics whilst simultaneously accounting for measurement error, offer more robust alternatives. Finally, we identify a need for more research to elucidate the role of physical oceanography, device effects, study animal selection, and developmental stages in predator behaviour and data interpretation.},

We used point counts (n ϭ 403) to collect data on agonistic behaviors and relative abundance within the study area. We used mist-netting to study site ﬁdelity on four 9-ha plots within and among years. We used radio-telemetry to measure Hermit Thrushes’ movements and territoriality (n ϭ 50). We found that Hermit Thrushes saturated suitable patches within the study area. Most Hermit Thrushes actively defended small [mean ϭ 0.55 Ϯ 0.03 (SE) ha], minimally overlapping (15.90 Ϯ 3.63\%) territories throughout the winter. Hermit Thrushes established and maintained territories using the same agonistic behaviors described for breeding birds. A few non-territorial birds (14\%) moved among occupied territories, but most were faithful to a larger neighborhood, apparently awaiting a territory vacancy. Territorial behavior and frequency of non-territorial birds did not differ among age and sex classes, suggesting the absence of a sex- or age-based dominance hierarchy. The behavior of Hermit Thrushes conformed to the emerging view that competition for spatially mediated resources on the wintering grounds, such as food or cover, contribute to limiting populations of many species of migrant passerines.

Given a sufficient minimum level of food supply, the difference in food availability between two males' territories may be great enough to permit a female to rear more young on the better territory, unaided by her mate, than she could on the poorer one even with full assistance from her mate. In this case, selection would favor a female pairing with the male on the better territory, even if this meant establishing a polygynous association.},

	abstract = {The mating behaviour of red deer stags, Cervus elaphus, has been extensively described as harem defence. However, it appears that territorialitymay be chosen as a mating strategy when certain conditions are met. In a study area in southwestern Spain, early on in the rut, about 58\% of adult males established territories in preferred areas, defended the territory against other males even in the absence of females, and courted females only within territorial boundaries. The mean territory size was about 2.3 ha. The later a male settled on his territory during the rut the fewer the females he was able to keep. The preferred areas where males established territories were also extensively used by females even before the start of the rut. The number of females per ha before the onset of the rut was positively correlated with the cumulative number of hinds that each male kept later on. Hence the reproductive success of males was largely influenced by the location of their territory. Such intensive use by females of a highly productive area for feeding and daily passage in an otherwise low-resource environment appears to promote the defence of territories located in the richest area. This paper provides the first evidence for territorial defence of mates in red deer and may contribute to the understanding of the dynamic nature of mating behaviour in ungulates.},

We estimated timing of parturition for 20 mule deer in northeastern Oregon, USA, using movement data from global positioning system (GPS) collars in 2005 and 2006. We then evaluated patterns of resource selection by female mule deer during late gestation, the week of parturition, and subsequent lactation to determine how diﬀerent stages of reproduction inﬂuenced habitat selection. Movement rates of all but one deer declined sharply between late-May and mid-June, when female mule deer give birth in northeastern Oregon. Patterns of resource selection also varied substantially relative to the estimated time of parturition. Prior to parturition, female mule deer selected gentle south-facing slopes dominated by ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa and avoided permanent water sources. Parturient females also selected areas used concurrently by elk Cervus elaphus. Following parturition, however, females selected steep north-facing slopes dominated by ﬁr Abies spp., avoided elk and selected habitat located close to permanent water sources. Stage of reproduction clearly inﬂuenced choice of habitat by female mule deer. Mule deer management plans should consider potential seasonal variability in the relative importance of forage, risk of predation and competition.},

	abstract = {Encounters between Scandinavian brown bears (Ursus arctos) and humans that result in human injuries and fatalities typically coincide with den entry in October and November, and commonly occur near a den. Our aim was to determine when bears arrive at their dens, identify potential predictors of this event, document behavior and activity associated with this period, and attempt to explain the increased risk of bearcaused human injuries in this period. We analyzed global positioning system (GPS) location and activity data from brown bears in south-central Sweden, using generalized linear mixed models, statistical process control, and activity analyses. Bears arrived at their den sites between 6 October and 1 December. Timing varied by reproductive category, bear age, and year. Half of all bears signiﬁcantly reduced their activity before arriving at the den area: on average 2,169 m away from the den and 1.8 days before arrival. The other half reduced their activity after arriving at the den area. The latter bears took longer time to reach hibernation activity levels, but we did not ﬁnd a difference in the start date of hibernation between the 2 groups. Bears also appeared to be sensitive to disturbance in this period, with higher den abandonment rates than later in winter, particularly for males and for bears that had not visited their den sites previously. Den entry occurred from October to December, with high variability and poor predictability of its timing. Therefore, restricting hunting or other recreation activities to reduce risk of injury by bears and disturbing bears probably would be both impractical and ineffective. Our ﬁndings can be used to educate hunters about bear behavior at this time of year. Many people associate dens with an increased risk of a bear responding aggressively to disturbance to defend its den, but our results indicate that other behavioral, and possibly physiological, changes in this period also may be involved.
