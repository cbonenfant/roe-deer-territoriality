                  animals have to move through various types of areas
                  that are more or less suitable with respect to their
                  current needs. The locations of the pro. table
                  places actually used, which may be only a subset of
                  the whole set of suitable areas available, are
                  usually unknown, but can be inferred from movement
                  analysis by assuming that these places correspond to
                  the limited areas where the animals spend more time
                  than elsewhere. Identifying these intensively used
                  areas makes it possible, through subsequent
                  analyses, to address both how they are distributed
                  with respect to key habitat features, and the
                  underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these
                  areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically
                  reviewed the few previously published methods to
                  detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur
                  when an animal enters a pro. table place. As all of
                  them appeared to be too narrowly tuned to specific
                  situations, we designed a new, easy-to-use method
                  based on the time spent in the vicinity of
                  successive path locations. We used computer
                  simulations to show that our method is both quite
                  general and robust to noisy data.},

                  ecological research. However, how and why home range
                  size varies between individuals is not well studied
                  or understood for most species. We develop a
                  hierarchical analytical approach-using generalized
                  linear mixed-effects modeling of time series of home
                  range sizes- that allows variance in home range size
                  to be decomposed into components due to variation in
                  temporal, spatial, and individual-level processes,
                  also facilitating intra-and interspecific
                  comparative analyses. We applied the approach to
                  data from a roe deer population radiotracked in
                  central Italy. Over multiple timescales, temporal
                  variation is explained by photoperiod and climate
                  and spatial variation by the distribution of habitat
                  types and spatial variance in radio-tracking
                  error. Differences between individuals explained a
                  substantial amount of variance in home range size,
                  but only a relatively minor part was explained by
                  the individual attributes of sex and age. We
                  conclude that the choice of temporal scale at which
                  data are collected and the definition of home range
                  can significantly influence biological inference. We
                  suggest that the appropriate choice of scale and
                  definition requires a good understanding of the
                  ecology and life history of the study species. Our
                  findings contrast with several common assumptions
                  about roe deer behavior.},

                  allows us to monitor and to map the details of
                  animal movement, securing vast quantities of such
                  data even for highly cryptic organisms. We envision
                  an exciting synergy between animal ecology and
                  GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of
                  new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual
                  advances, where research opportunities have been
                  paralleled by technical and analytical
                  challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental
                  unit of movement paths and show where individuals
                  interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss
                  how knowing where animals go can help scientists in
                  their search for a mechanistic understanding of key
                  concepts of animal ecology, including resource use,
                  home range and dispersal, and population
                  dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant
                  future, intense sampling of movements coupled with
                  detailed information on habitat features at a
                  variety of scales will allow us to represent an
                  animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the
                  intimate relationship between behaviour and
                  fitness. An extended use of these data over long
                  periods of time and over large spatial scales can
                  provide robust inferences for complex,
                  multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of
                  the effects of climate change on animal behaviour
                  and distribution.},

                  agonistic encounters can be reduced by prior
                  .isse\$sment of opponents: it will generally pay low
                  quality animals to avoid combat with onc of high
                  quality. Following this principle it is suggested
                  that territory owners scent mark rheir territories
                  to provide intruders with a ineaiis of
                  :issessnient. When the odour of a competitor, or of
                  a mark it is seen t o have made, matches that of
                  scent marks encountered in the vicinity, then the
                  competitor is probably the territory owner. Since
                  owners are generally hifih quality animals, and
                  assuming they have more to gain by retaining a
                  territory than an intrudcr h.is in taking it over,
                  it will pay the owner to escalate and the intruder
                  to give up early. The advantage to owners in
                  markin:; may thus be that by allowing themselves to
                  be identified they reduce the costs of territory
                  defence. Published information on the behaviour of
                  territory owners and intruders is consistent with
                  predictions from this hypothesis. The hypothesis
                  offers an explanation for a number of poorly

  abstract     = {In species in which males defend territories for
                  breeding, males may differ in territorial behavior;
                  alternative behaviors among territorial males are
                  not well understood. In our long-term study of
                  partially-migratory song sparrows, we have observed
                  that most territorial males establish territories
                  before females begin nesting and remain
                  site-faithful both within and between breeding
                  seasons; however, some males establish territories
                  later in the season (late establishers) and/or
                  change territory locations either within or between
                  seasons (movers). Whether late establishment or
                  moving are equally successful strategies for
                  territory defense, or best-of-bad-job options, is
                  not known. Here, we compare the frequencies of these
                  behaviors to demographic variables over a 9-yr
                  period and compare lifetime tenure and early season
                  nesting success for males who differ in site
                  fidelity and timing of territory
                  establishment. Across years, late establishing was
                  negatively correlated with the return rate of
                  previously territorial males; moving was positively
                  correlated with the number of occupied territories
                  at the start of the breeding season (territory
                  density). While moving was independent of number of
                  years on territory, late territory establishment
                  only occurred in a male's first year as a territory
                  holder. Of 88 males, 25\% established their first
                  territory late, primarily in undefended space; 31\%
                  moved. Late and early establishers did not differ in
                  lifetime tenure; movers, however, had longer
                  lifetime tenure than site-faithful males. Among
                  early establishers, movers and non-movers did not
                  differ in the number of successful early nests/year
                  or number of young fledged/year; among late
                  establishers, however, movers had significantly
                  higher early nesting success by both measures. Late
                  establishers who moved had higher early season
                  nesting success and higher early season nesting
                  success/year than site-faithful early
                  establishers. Thus, individual variation in the
                  timing of territory establishment and site fidelity
                  may be facultative alternative territorial
                  strategies.},

                  these advances have been accompanied by the
                  development of new methods of data analysis for
                  portraying space use, home ranges and utilization

                  data-intensive techniques such as kriging and
                  nonlinear generalized regression models for habitat
                  use. In addition, mechanistic home-range models,
                  derived from models of animal movement behaviour,
                  promise to offer new insights into how home ranges

                  environment. Traditional methods such as kernel
                  density estimators are likely to remain popular

                  temporal variation in space-use patterns. Although
                  new technologies open new avenues in ecological
                  research, our knowledge of why animals use space in

  abstract     = {1. It is widely accepted that the arrival order of
                  migratory birds is correlated with the condition of
                  the birds, which leads to high quality individuals
                  occupying prime sites. However, the theoretical
                  backgrounds for this argument have been lacking. A
                  simple game-theoretic model of arrival timing is
                  provided which investigates the evolutionary
                  stability of condition-dependent arrival order in
                  territorial migrant birds. 2. Competition for
                  territories or other priority-dependent benefits can
                  lead to arrival dates far preceding the
                  cost-minimizing date (the optimum date in the
                  absence of competition) for all but the weakest
                  individuals. Increasing the number of competitors
                  can generate a ‘cascading’ competition for early
                  arrival, which advances arrival dates further apart
                  from the individual optimum dates for the onset of
                  breeding. 3. At equilibrium, arrival order
                  corresponds strictly to condition order only if
                  marginal costs of advancing arrival are always
                  larger for individuals in lower condition. If spring
                  mortality vacates territories for later-arriving
                  birds, the criterion for ‘honest’ arrival order
                  becomes still stricter: differential survival costs
                  should exist, but survival differences among
                  individuals (or, alternatively, territory quality
                  differences) should not be very large. 4. If the
                  habitat is saturated so that there is a risk of not
                  obtaining a territory at all, or if worst
                  territories are of much lower value than the rest,
                  competition may lead to the majority of the
                  population arriving within a fairly short interval,
                  followed by a much later floating fraction. This
                  synchrony in the arrival of breeders imposes an
                  increasing cost for the lesser fit breeding
                  birds. Thus, arrival costs paid are not necessarily
                  highest for earliest arriving individuals, but for

  abstract     = {Both species and populations within species display
                  variation in spacing patterns, and the number of
                  published reports documenting this variation is
                  increasing rapidly. The potential for instructive
                  comparisons is high, but the comparative approach
                  requires common terminology. Vague or implicit
                  definitions of spacing systems undermine the rigour
                  of comparisons. Papers were reviewed that examined
                  interspecific and intraspecific variation in spacing
                  systems to determine the degree to which definitions
                  currently produce a common terminology. This report
                  describes and classifies the 48 conceptual and
                  operational definitions of territoriality found in
                  the literature. Only 12\% of the papers gave an
                  operational definition of territoriality. The single
                  criterion of ‘defended area’ was used in 50\% of the
                  papers, and the other 50\% used other definitions
                  which often consisted of multiple criteria. These
                  definitions were variants of three main themes:
                  defended area, exclusive area, and site-specific
                  dominance, and authors used up to three criteria to
                  define territoriality. Conceptual and operational
                  definitions differed because different questions
                  were asked and because of logistical problems, such
                  as collecting the same data on different species or
                  populations. The taxonomic group being studied also
                  seemed to determine which type of definition was
                  chosen. Although defended area was used most often
                  across four classes of vertebrates, researchers
                  studying mammals chose spatial criteria, for
                  example, amount of home range overlap, more often
                  than researchers studying other taxa. Workers
                  pursuing research in this area can enhance their
                  contribution by using clear conceptual and
                  operational definitions of territoriality, making
                  them explicit at the outset.},

                  enclosure. The animals (three young males, four
                  adult females) were monitored with GPS telemetry
                  collars. As expected, the surface area and overlap
                  of the males' bimonthly ranges decreased, and the
                  distance between their arithmetic centres increased,
                  as they became adult and, for two of them,
                  territorial. Unexpectedly, females also tended to
                  space out, the surface area and overlap of their
                  bimonthly ranges being minimal in May to June,
                  i.e. during the birth period. The distance between
                  their arithmetic centres reached its maximum at the
                  same time. Overlap between females' ranges was
                  consistently lower than those between males and
                  females' ranges, or between 1-year old males'
                  ranges. Our results raise the questions of female
                  seasonal territoriality and of independence of the

  abstract     = {Locating and monitoring animals using tracking
                  devices is a method commonly used for many taxa to
                  study characteristics Such as home-range size,
                  habitat selection, movement patterns and other
                  aspects of ranging behaviour. Fitting such devices
                  requires the capture and handling of the study
                  organism and researchers must then assume that a
                  monitored animal behaves in a 'normal' way. We
                  investigated whether the capture and handling of roe
                  deer Capreolus capreolus induced behavioural
                  alterations. In particular, we expected that the roe
                  deer would exhibit a 'seeking a refuge and waiting
                  before returning' strategy immediately after
                  release, taking shelter far from the capture scene,
                  in closed habitat, and exhibiting a reduced activity
                  level. We evaluated the effect of capture and
                  handling on 112 roe deer equipped with GPS collars,
                  during a period of 50 days after release. We
                  compared the first 10 days after release with the
                  subsequent days for the following behavioural
                  parameters: distance to the barycentre of their GPS
                  fixes, presence in forest habitat, distance to the
                  nearest forest patch, distance to a source of human
                  disturbance, and activity level. We found pronounced
                  differences in terms of spatial behaviour, habitat
                  use and overall activity level between the two
                  periods in GPS monitored roe deer. We also found
                  differences in terms of spatial displacement between
                  the sexes, with females responding less than males,
                  and among age classes, with yearlings responding
                  most and fawns least, to the capture and handling
                  event. Finally, spatial displacement of roe deer
                  increased with openness of the habitat due, in part,
                  to the scarcity of available shelter in open
                  areas. We conclude that the roe deer exhibited a
                  strategy consisting of seeking a refuge and waiting
                  before returning after capture, handling and fitting
                  of a collar, with displacement towards a refuge
                  habitat, in or near woodland, avoidance of sources
                  of human disturbance and reduced activity
                  levels. From a practical point of view, we recommend
                  removing data during the first days of monitoring as
                  behavioural alterations due to capture and handling
                  may be pronounced.},

  abstract     = {Despite widespread interest in territorial behavior,
                  the processes by which animals establish territories
                  are still poorly understood. We present a new
                  learning-based model of territory establishment for
                  species in which individuals set up territories
                  within large patches of spatially heterogeneous
                  habitat. The model is based on the simple
                  assumptions that individuals tend to return to areas
                  in which they previously had rewarding experiences
                  and, conversely, tend to avoid areas in which they
                  previously engaged in costly aggressive
                  interactions. The literature on learning and
                  territorial establishment suggests that these
                  assumptions are probably valid for many
                  animals. Individual-based, spatially-explicit
                  simulations of settlement behavior incorporating the
                  assumptions of this model generate a number of
                  phenomena comparable to those observed in
                  territorial animals, including the formation of
                  stable home ranges within large patches of uniform
                  quality habitat, increases in territory size and
                  home range exclusivity if settlers interact
                  aggressively with one another, greater benefits of
                  aggressive behavior if individuals settle at high
                  density than if they settle at low density, higher
                  success for residents when they compete with
                  newcomers for the same space (the "prior residency
                  advantage"), and the avoidance by newcomers of areas
                  used by previous residents. Although the model needs
                  further refinement to generate some phenomena
                  observed in territorial species, our results suggest
                  that the processes responsible for generating
                  several basic components of territorial behavior may
                  be simpler than is currently supposed.},

                  territorial ungulate, the European roe deer
                  (Capreolus capreolus). YBS in both populations was
                  markedly age-structured, with 3 distinct stages,
                  supporting the dome-shaped pattern of variation
                  commonly reported for age-dependent variation in
                  life-history traits of ungulates. YBS was low at 2
                  years of age, peaked at 3–8 years of age, and tended
                  to decline afterwards (senescence). Most males

                  year olds) were likely fast-growing individuals that

                  tend to have highly polygynous mating systems
                  associated with high variance in male lifetime
                  reproductive success (LRS), leading to a high
                  opportunity for sexual selection. However, little
                  information is available for species with weak
                  sexual size dimorphism. In a long-term study
                  population, we used parentage analysis based on 21
                  microsatellite markers to describe, for the first
                  time, variance in male lifetime breeding success
                  (LBS) of roe deer, a territorial ungulate where
                  males weigh less than 10\% more than females. LBS
                  ranged from 0 to 14 (mean = 4.54, variance = 15.5),
                  and its distribution was highly skewed, with only a
                  few males obtaining high LBS and many males failing
                  to breed or siring only one fawn. As predicted for
                  polygynous species with low sexual size dimorphism,
                  the standardized variance in male LBS was low (I-m =
                  0.75) and was only slightly higher than the
                  standardized variance in female LRS (I-f = 0.53),
                  suggesting a low opportunity for sexual
                  selection. The I-m value reported here for roe deer
                  is much lower than values reported for highly
                  dimorphic ungulates such as red deer (I-m
                  {\textgreater} 3). We suggest that, along a
                  continuum of opportunity for sexual selection, roe
                  deer occupy a position closer to monogamous and
                  monomorphic territorial ungulates than to highly
                  polygynous, sexually dimorphic ungulates with
                  dominance rank-based mating systems such as harems
                  or roving mating systems.},

                  absent in male bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus but a
                  minority has suggested that some exclusive
                  mechanisms act between adult males. This study
                  provides indirect evidence for the existence of
                  territorial structures between adult male bushbuck
                  by comparing home-range overlap between adult and
                  sub-adult males. The spatial organization of
                  individuals in relation to each other was
                  established by using numerical
                  classiﬁcation. Location ﬁxes of 52 males, each
                  individual distinguished by a characteristic coat
                  pattern, were taken over a period of 3 years. Home
                  ranges were estimated using the ﬁxed kernel density
                  estimator. Two indices (coefﬁcient of overlap, index
                  of overlap) were applied to compare home-range
                  overlap between the different male age
                  classes. There was a strong home-range overlap up to
                  the 30\% home-range core between sub-adult as well
                  as between adult and sub-adult males, while adult
                  male home ranges overlapped up to the 50\%
                  home-range core only. It could be shown that home
                  ranges of adult males overlapped signiﬁcantly less
                  than those of sub-adult males and those between
                  sub-adult and adult males indicating an exclusive
                  use of central core areas (home sites). Sub-adult
                  males form bachelor pools without being permanently
                  associated. With increasing age, sub-adult males
                  challenge territory holders and replace them in
                  order to take over their exclusive areas. These
                  maturing sub-adult males (young adults), often
                  focused on a particular territory holder denoting
